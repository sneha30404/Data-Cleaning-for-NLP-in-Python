# Data-Cleaning-for-NLP-in-Python

## Overview
This repository contains essential techniques for **data cleaning in Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using Python. The provided Jupyter notebooks cover various preprocessing steps to clean and prepare textual data for NLP tasks.

## Topics Covered
- **Text Normalization** – Lowercasing, removing special characters, and expanding contractions.  
- **Tokenization** – Splitting text into meaningful units (words, sentences).  
- **Stopword Removal** – Filtering out common words like *the*, *is*, *and*, etc.  
- **Stemming & Lemmatization** – Reducing words to their base forms.  
- **Handling Punctuation & Special Characters** – Cleaning unnecessary symbols.  
- **Removing Duplicates & Noise** – Eliminating unwanted data like HTML tags, numbers, or extra spaces.  

## Installation
To use this repository, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install pandas nltk re numpy
```

## Key Takeaways
- Converting text to lowercase helps standardize data.
- Regular expressions are useful for removing unwanted characters.
- Tokenization breaks down text into meaningful units.
- Stopword removal eliminates common words that do not add meaning.
- Stemming and Lemmatization reduce words to their base forms.
- A well-preprocessed dataset improves NLP model performance.
